The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the data has been fully loaded. This can happen if you use asynchronous functions that access the snapshot before the promise resolves. For example, if you have a function that retrieves a document from Firestore and then immediately tries to access its data, there is a risk that the data may not be loaded yet, resulting in an error.
